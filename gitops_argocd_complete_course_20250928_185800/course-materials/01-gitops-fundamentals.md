## What is GitOps?

**GitOps** = **Git** + **Operations**

GitOps is a modern approach to continuous deployment and infrastructure management that uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Declarative**: Infrastructure and application configuration is expressed declaratively
- **Versioned and Immutable**: Configuration is stored in Git, providing version history
- **Pulled Automatically**: Software agents automatically pull the desired state from Git
- **Continuously Reconciled**: The actual state is continuously reconciled with the desired state

## GitOps Principles

### 1. Declarative Everything
- Define desired state (in YAML, HCL, etc.), not step-by-step actions
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Application as Code
- Describe **what** you want, not **how** to get there

### 2. Git as Source of Truth
- Only Git holds the official configuration
- No ad-hoc manual changes to production systems
- All changes must go through Git
- Configuration drift is automatically corrected

### 3. Pull/Merge Requests for Changes
- All changes go through versioned Pull Requests (PRs) for approval and auditability
- Code review process ensures quality and security
- Approval workflows and automated testing

### 4. Continuous Reconciliation by Agents
- GitOps tools (like Argo CD or Flux) continuously watch Git
- Automated agents reconcile live environments with Git state
- Self-healing systems that correct configuration drift

## GitOps vs Traditional DevOps

| Aspect | Traditional DevOps | GitOps |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Deployment Model** | Push-based (CI/CD pushes to production) | Pull-based (agents pull from Git) |
| **Source of Truth** | Multiple sources (CI/CD tools, scripts) | Single source (Git repository) |
| **Change Management** | Manual deployments, scripts | Declarative, automated reconciliation |
| **Rollbacks** | Complex, manual process | Simple Git revert |
| **Security** | Shared credentials, push access | No direct cluster access, pull-based |
| **Auditability** | Limited visibility | Full Git history and audit trail |

## Benefits of GitOps

### 1. Enhanced Security
- **No Direct Cluster Access**: Developers don't need direct access to production
- **Credential Management**: Reduced exposure of cluster credentials
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes in Git
- **Signed Commits**: Cryptographic verification of changes

### 2. Improved Reliability
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic correction of configuration drift
- **Consistent Deployments**: Same process across all environments
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy rollbacks using Git history
- **Disaster Recovery**: Entire system state stored in Git

### 3. Faster Development Velocity
- **Automated Deployments**: No manual intervention required
- **Faster Releases**: Streamlined deployment process
- **Reduced Errors**: Elimination of manual deployment mistakes
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work independently

## GitOps Best Practices

### 1. Repository Structure
- **Separate Application and Configuration Repos**: Keep application code separate from deployment configuration
- **Environment-Based Branching**: Use branches or directories for different environments
- **Modular Configuration**: Use tools like Kustomize or Helm for reusable components

### 2. Security Practices
- **Signed Commits**: Use GPG signing for commit verification
- **RBAC**: Implement proper Role-Based Access Control
- **Secret Management**: Use dedicated tools for managing secrets
- **Policy as Code**: Define and enforce policies using tools like OPA/Gatekeeper

### 3. Automation
- **Fully Automated Pipelines**: Minimize manual interventions
- **Automated Testing**: Include testing in the GitOps pipeline
- **Rollback Automation**: Implement automatic rollback on failure
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automate security and compliance checks

**Key Takeaways:**
- GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and applications
- It provides better security, reliability, and development velocity
- Pull-based deployments are more secure than push-based
- Automation and continuous reconciliation are core to GitOps success
